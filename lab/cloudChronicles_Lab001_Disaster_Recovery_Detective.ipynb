    "**Situation:**  \n",
    "[A regional outage has occurred in Google Cloud‚Äôs us-central1 region, affecting Cloud SQL databases, Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub messaging. The goal is to mitigate downtime and restore services as quickly as possible.]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**  \n",
    "[Ensure business continuity by failing over to backup resources. Minimize data loss and recovery time. Maintain communication for operational teams via alerts..]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:**  \n",
    "[Cloud SQL Replicas & Failover. Ensure Cloud SQL High Availability (HA) is enabled with automatic failover. Use read replicas in another region (e.g., us-east1). Promote a read replica to a primary instance to restore database operations. Multi-Region Cloud Storage Store critical backups in multi-region buckets or dual-region setups (e.g., nam4 for North America). Redirect application storage operations to the failover region. Enable Object Versioning to safeguard against unintended data loss. Pub/Sub Alerts & Workflow Recovery Set up Pub/Sub notifications to detect outages and trigger automated responses. Use Cloud Functions or Cloud Run to re-route event processing to another region. Enable Dead Letter Topics to prevent data loss in message queuing.]\n",

    "**Expected Result:**  \n",
    "[By implementing this strategy: ‚úÖ Database operations resume with minimal downtime via Cloud SQL replicas. ‚úÖ Storage availability is maintained via multi-region Cloud Storage. ‚úÖ Event-driven applications stay functional with Pub/Sub and Cloud Functions. ‚úÖ Operational teams receive real-time alerts and can take corrective action.]"
